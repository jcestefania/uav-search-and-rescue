def query_features(area_geopolygon: GeoPolygon, tags_to_query: dict) -> dict | None:
    """
    Queries features from OpenStreetMap within the given area_geopolygon using specified tags.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    area_geopolygon: GeoPolygon object representing the query area. Must be in WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
    tags_to_query: dict, OSM tags to query (e.g., {"building": True}). This function expects
                     that this dict represents a single feature type for querying, where keys
                     are OSM tags and values are tag values.
                     If you need to query multiple types, call this function for each.

    Returns:
    --------
    dict | None: A dictionary where keys are the top-level keys from tags_to_query (representing categories)
                  and values are Shapely geometries (or MultiGeometries) of the queried features,
                  intersected with the area_geopolygon. Geometries are in WGS84.
                  Returns None if an error occurs during querying or if the area_geopolygon CRS is not WGS84.
